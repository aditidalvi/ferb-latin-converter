        <p>During their routine summer fun, the two brothers Phineas and Ferb(in a Dinsney series) create their own language, Ferb Latin which quickly catches on. </p><p>To speak it you must take the first letter of every word, move it to the end, and then say '-erb'\; though two-letter words stay the same.</p> <p>Ferb Latin has non-verbal cues as well, such as reaching for the sky to say "okay, " cracking your knuckles to say that you're hungry, doing jazz hands when you smell something bad, twisting your toungue and teeth to say everything is ok, and blowing a raspberry to say goodbye.</p>
